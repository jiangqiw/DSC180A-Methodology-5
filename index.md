## Prompt Questions:

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic I have found so far is the mix-precision quantization. It seems to me that unquantize the very first layer and also the very last layer both have a point.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation might be applying the neural tangent kernel on convolutional neural network for model compression.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would like to not only changing the hyper-parameter, but also different pre-trained model with different structure and see how it perform.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in using large computing resources to quantize a LLM.
